# Mythical Creatures

## Installation Steps

1. Read the README.md
2. Run your first test suite ```npm test test/unicorn-test.js```
3. Make the tests pass
4. Lather, rinse, repeat through the creatures in order

## Creature Order

* `unicorn_test.rb`
* `vampire_test.rb`
* `dragon_test.rb`
* `hobbit_test.rb`
* `pirate_test.rb`
* `wizard_test.rb`
* `medusa_test.rb`
* `werewolf_test.rb`
* `centaur_test.rb`

## Extra Challenges

### The Dreaded `if` Statement

Can you complete implementations of each of the creatures without using `if`
statements? Think about how removing them affects your code.

### Imagine Two Creatures

Can you add two new creatures to the repository? How about a Hydra? Add unit
tests exercising some of the following concepts:

* Initializing constructor with data
* Using methods to change the internal state of an instance
* Using methods to query the internal state of an instance
