# Wizarding Objects

## Installation Steps

Before you can work on or run any of these tests, you need to make sure you install the dependencies. The directions are at the [root-level of this repository](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/javascript-foundations).

### Running the Tests

You can run the tests from the root of this repository. When you type `pwd` in the console, the last path location should be `javascript-foundations`.

Run the command `npm test wizarding-objects/test/pet-test.js`. To run other tests, just replace the test file name.

#### Practicing new javascript features

Notice, some of the syntax with the tests and files are using newer javascript features introduced in es6, like arrow functions, block-scoped variables, and classes.  See if you can start flexing your es6 muscles and write your solutions and tests using the new syntax!  

### Make the tests pass in the following sequence:

* `test/pet-test.js`
* `test/wand-test.js`
* `test/wizard-test.js`
