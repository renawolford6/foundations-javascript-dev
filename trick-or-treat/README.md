# Objects and Functions

## Installation Steps

Before you can work on or run any of these tests, you need to make sure you install the dependencies. The directions are at the [root-level of this repository](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/javascript-foundations).

### Running the Tests

You can run the tests from the root of this repository. When you type `pwd` in the console, the last path location should be `javascript-foundations`.

Run the command `npm test trick-or-treat/test/candy-test.js`. To run other tests, just replace the test file name.

### Make the tests pass in the following sequence:

* test/candy-test.js  
* test/bag-test.js  
* test/costume-test.js  
* test/trick-or-treater-test.js
